# Authentication
This repository contains code examples for implementing user authentication using different methods. The goal of this repository is to help developers learn the authentication processes and provide them with reusable code for their own projects.

## Approach
This repository provides three different approaches to user authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth 2.0, and credentials-based sessions. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific needs of the project.

## JWT
[JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) are a popular method of authentication that use a JSON object to securely transmit information between parties. JWT is widely used in modern web applications due to its ease of use, scalability, and statelessness.

## OAuth 2.0
[OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749) is an open standard for access delegation that allows users to grant access to their data on one site to another site. This approach is widely used by large companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter to provide users with a simple way to authenticate and authorize their access to third-party applications.

## Sessions
Sessions are a traditional method of authentication that involve storing user data on the server. When a user logs in, their data is stored in a session on the server, and a unique session ID is sent to the client. Subsequent requests from the client include the session ID, which the server uses to retrieve the user's data and determine their identity.

## Usage
Each directory in this repository contains code examples for implementing the corresponding authentication approach. To use the code in your own projects, simply copy the relevant files and modify them to suit your needs.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a new approach or would like to improve an existing one, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
